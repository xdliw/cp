/*
questions:
	how to assign priorities?
		if randomly then what if some priorities are same?
			But, where do we use priorities?
			maybe its going to work as if they were different. like maybe it only matters when merging, so its going to be in one of cases: <,>= or >,<=
	why inorder order is preserved after merge?
